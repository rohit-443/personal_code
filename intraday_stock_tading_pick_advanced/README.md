The code built here scans given list of stocks and shortlists the stocks that are about to rise by considering the similar situations encountered in the last 3 years of stock data.
So, technically we are testing every stock based on the 3 years historical back testing.

In the code we written, we are calculating values of the different indicators.
1.) SMA20, 50 & 200
2.) RSI
3.) MACD
4.) WILLIAM_%R
5.) CCI
6.) OBV AND AD LINE
7.) MFI

There are different types of significances for all these indicators to predict the swing of the stock in next trading sessions.

based on those we are seggregating the picks into 3 types
1.) DIAMOND PICK
2.) GOLDEN PICK
3.) SILVER PICK

We believes that **some of the stocks** comes under **diamond pick** will be giving swing trade advantage in the next trading sessions.

**Important:**
1.) As part of the process there is an inbuilt functionality which sends us the report of stock names and its pick category over gmail.
this is the sample mail report (intentionally cropped as it might be taking as financial advice by users)

2.) The plots will be generated based on the 3 years data of every shortlisted stock and it will be uploaded to the personal drive automatically.
